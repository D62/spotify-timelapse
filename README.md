# Spotify Timelapse

Display a bar chart race animation based on your Spotify streams.

## How to use:
* Open https://spotify-timelapse.streamlit.app/
* Follow the instructions

## Local installation

### Prerequisites

* [Python >= 3.8](https://www.python.org/)
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

#### Installing ffmpeg

In order to save animations as mp4 files, you must install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), which allows for conversion to many different formats of video and audio. For macOS users, installation may be [easier using Homebrew](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/macOS#ffmpegthroughHomebrew).

After installation, ensure that `ffmpeg` has been added to your path by going to your command line and entering `ffmepg -version`.
